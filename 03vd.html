<br>	Video provides a powerful way to help you prove your point. <br>
When you click Online Video, you can paste in the embed code for <br>
the video you want to add. You can also type a keyword to search <br>
online for the video that best fits your document. To make your document <br>
look professionally produced, Word provides header, footer, cover page, <br>
and text box designs that complement each other. For example, <br>
you can add a matching cover page, header, and sidebar. Click Insert and <br>
then choose the elements you want from the different galleries. <br>
Themes and styles also help keep your document coordinated. When you  <br>
click Design and choose a new Theme, the pictures, charts, <br>
and SmartArt graphics change to match your new theme.<br>
