<h2>Today's topic is- Definition list & Glossary list </h2>
<p>
To describe or to define a term in a webpage, this type of tagging is used for. Here we have 2 terms to define. At first, simple definition and then we will use definition listing. 
<br> <b> 1. Cryptocurrency </b> <br> A digital currency in which transactions are verified and records maintained by a decentralized system using cryptography, rather than by a centralized authority.
<br> <b> 2. Cryptography </b> <br> The art of writing or solving codes. <br>
<br>Now these two above in the form of <u>definition list</u>-
<dl> 
	<dt> Cryptocurrency  </dt> <dd> A digital currency in which transactions are verified and records maintained by a decentralized system using cryptography, rather than by a centralized authority. </dd>
	<dt> Cryptography  </dt> <dd> The art of writing or solving codes.  </dd>
</dl>
</p>
<u> Remeber that </u> <ul type="square">
<li> <mark> dt </mark> (define-TERM):tag is use to define a term in the list </li>
<li> <mark> dd </mark> (define-DESCRIPTION):tag is use to describe a term  in the list </li>
</ul>
<b> format: </b> <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp dl- <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp dt- <small> (your term/ product name to be defined) </small> - /dt <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp dd - <small> definition and description of the term/ product </small> -/dd- <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp/dl
