</figure> <mark>Mulgach</mark>| There are only 24 hours between the moment the tea leaves are plucked and the minute they're packed up. But what happens during these 24 hours is crucial, as this is when the destiny of the leaves will be determined: will they be black, green or in-between? Caffeinated or decaff? There's no more important time in a tea leaf's life!<br><br>

</figure> <mark>Shirsho mukul</mark>| The orthodox tea making method is the most commonly used. In this process, the tea leaves go through four stages: withering, rolling, oxidation and drying.<br><strong>Withering</strong><br>When they arrive at the factory, tea leaves are full of moisture. This first stage reduces their water content to about 60%−70%. This is done by laying out the tea leaves in big troughs on a wire mesh. Air is then passed over them, gently drying them out. This takes between 12−17 hours, leaving the leaves bendy and ready to be rolled.<br><strong>Rolling</strong><br>In the past, tea leaves were rolled by hand. Today, most factories place them on a rolling machine, which rotates horizontally on a rolling table. This movement twists and turns the leaves until they're thin and wiry looking. It also breaks them up, which starts the next stage: oxidation.<br><br>

</figure> <mark>Pata chera</mark>|<strong>Oxidation</strong><br>The oxidation process determines the tea's colour, taste and strength.First, the leaves are put in troughs or laid out on tables. Then, they're left for between 30 minutes and two hours, at a temperature of about 26°C.<br/>During this time, enzymes inside the leaves react with the air around them, changing the leaves' colour from green to beige, to a rich, deep brown. The colour indicates how oxidised the tea is and what its flavour will be like. To make a tea with a lighter taste, the oxidation process is stopped when the leaves are light brown. For a stronger tea, the leaves will remain in the warmth until they're rich and coppery.<br><strong>Drying or firing</strong><br>Once the leaves have been oxidised to the right level, they're passed through hot air dryers. This further reduces their water content to about 3%, leaving them ready to be sorted and packed<strong>THE CTC METHOD||Cut-Tear-Curl</strong>.<br><br>

</figure> <mark>Kula</mark>|The next stage in the production of tea is the sorting process. Before they leave the tea factory, all the teas - black, green, white and  Oolong - are graded and sorted.<br>Because different sized leaves brew at different speeds, the leaves are separated into batches of the same size.<br><br>

</figure> <mark>Jhura Pata</mark>|Next, the leaves are classified by size, type and appearance. Different countries have their own systems for classifying tea. In China, teas are named by the region they came from, the way they were made and the type of leaf, or the legend behind the tea.<br>Then the teas are finally ready to be packed into foil-lined paper sacks or tea chests. These keep the leaves dry and protect them from the knocks and bumps of their onward journey.
