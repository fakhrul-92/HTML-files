<h2>Today's topic is- DOCKTYPE html declaration for a webpage </h2>

<p>
Format <b style="font-size:25px; color: purple; font-family:Cooper"> 
!DOCKTYPE html 
</b> <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
	- use this format inside the angular bracket
</p>

<p>
<q> !DOCTYPE html </q> is a declaration (<i> not a tag </i>) that helps your <b> browser </b> to read it properly. We see this declation, normally, on top of the coding inside of a webpage-inspection.
<br><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
	- Use an exclametory sign before your declation. <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
	- Write DOCKTYPE in capital and html in small for <strong> </i> html-5 </i> </strong> <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
	- Don't forget the angular bracket. <br>
