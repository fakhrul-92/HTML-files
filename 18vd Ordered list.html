<h2>Today's topic is- creating list in a webpage </h2>

<p>
From now on, in the  footer section, we will be using listing. When we use listing tags, we need 2 types of listing tags. <ol> <li> listing object separator. It is <b> <strong style="color: #700060"> li </strong> </b> only </li> <li> order declation tag. It is mainly <strong style="color: #700060"> ordered, unordered & definition </strong> list.</li> </ol><br>
There are <b> 3types of lists </b> in a webpage. They are-<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
	- Ordered list: Tag is- <b style="font-size:25px; color: purple; font-family:Cooper"> ol </b> <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
	        Format: <u> <b> OL-li.. .. .. .. (list objects)-li-OL </b> </u> <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  
	- Un-ordered list: Tag is- <b style="font-size:25px; color: purple; font-family:Cooper"> ul </b> <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
	        Format: <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
	- Definition list: Tag is- <b style="font-size:25px; color: purple; font-family:Cooper"> dl </b> <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
	        Format: <br> 
By using them, we can scape from <b style="color: yellow"> blockquote </b> tag. We will be sorting our list. <br>
<u> Note:</u>
<ul type="I"> <li> In ordered list, things are normally listed in order with 1, 2, 3 etc </li> 
<li>In Unordered list, things are normally listed in order with BIG_DOT </li>
<li> If you intend to use a, b, c, .. .. Use <b> type="" attribute </b> and inside "" type a. Then complete  your listing</li> 
<li> In type attribute, you can use A-for-capital-listing, i-for-roman-listing </li> 
<li> To start from numbers grater than 1 in the list, like, 8, 9, 10, .. .. use <b> start="" attribute</b> . Inside "" type 8 to start listing from 8</li> </ul>

<ol>
<li> Creating list on a webpage </li>
<li> Better practice is- you use <b> ENTER </b> after every list objects </li>
</ol>
